c-lessons
=========

Im  reciving programming lessions at school (currently in *C*).
This is what I'm coding during thoes lessons (although my code here is not necessarily related to those lessons).

stdfuns.h
---------

Contains some definitions/inclusions I frequently use.
If I write somethin over and over again, I should be put into stdfuns.

naming-scheme
-------------

    ${CHAPTER_NO}_${NAME}

Also the exercises where numbered in the beginning but the numbers got mixed up.

codeing style
-------------

*Don't use this as an example how to write code.*

The code I've written here is not a example of good code.
One reason for this is that I have not done any  cleanups.

However, if you have remarks concerning the code style
- especially about the use of pointers - feel free to leave a comment
in the issue-tracker.

noticable
---------

Nice ascii art:
* 2erpot
* Christmas Tree
* Hanoi

TODO
----

* Index
* Test all old stuff
* remove implicit memory allocation from stdfuns
